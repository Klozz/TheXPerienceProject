** Note **
 * AOSP roms (based in demon and akash) are not supported and
   Some MIUI based in last miui dev (seems xiaomi has change
   things in FOD and seems broken)
 * This maybe is the last build for cepheus. I don't have $ to buy a cepheus and give it a proper support.
   It was nice while it lasted.
